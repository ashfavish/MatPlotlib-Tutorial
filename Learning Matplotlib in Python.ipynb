    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key skills within Data Science is being able to visualize data in order to better understand it. One of the main packages for plotting within Python is called Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we use any of the methods in python, we need to import the package.\n",
    "Most coders abbreviate this package to plt and therefore it is good practice to do the same in order for other people to understand your code.\n",
    "To import Matplotlib we write the following line in python:\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib.pyplot contains command like functions which each make a change to a figure e.g. create figure, create a plot, plot some lines in plotting area, customize plot with labels and legends etc. \n",
    "The various states which are called are preserved across function calls i.e.  it keeps track of functions called such as the plotting area, axes etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call all methods we use the syntax plt.method()\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps to creating plots with matplotlib are:              \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare data \n",
    "2.  Plot\n",
    "3.  Customize plot \n",
    "4. Show plot \n",
    "\n",
    "_Plotting_\n",
    "The .plot method of pyplot to plots the respective data points. \n",
    "The .plot takes many parameters, but the first two here are 'x' and 'y' coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "_Customization_\n",
    "A few examples will be looked at in future exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "_Show Plot_\n",
    "The plt.plot will \"draw\"  a plot in the background, but  if we want to view the plot, we use the plt.show() method.\n",
    "This is done once all the specifications of the plot have been run"

    " e.g. \n",

    "1) Import pandas and create a pandas dataframe of the Iris data using the URL above and pandas.read_csv() method. The url  data doesn't include the title headings but you can include them by including the parameter \"names=[]\" when you read in the data.  \n",
    "2) Add a fun style to your plot.  \n",
    "3) Create a boxplot to show the distribution of each Iris feature. Try add a title to your boxplot.  \n",
    "4) Now create a boxplot with each feature on its own subplot.  \n",
    "5) Explore the data visually by using other pandas plotting features such as histograms and density plots."
